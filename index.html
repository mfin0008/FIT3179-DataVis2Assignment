                <h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">How do Techtonic Plates Affect Earthquake Intensity?</h2>
                <div style="width:50vw; margin:5vh 0vw;">
                    <p align="justify" style="font-size: x-large;">
                        Underneath the Earth's crust exist techtonic plates which are moving very slowly.
                        These plates can be seen by the blue lines in the map below.
                        As they rub against each other, the friction causes them to stick.
                        However, when they overcome this friction, they slip.
                        This slip causes a shockwave that travels through the earth's crust,
                        eventually causing the ground to shake - <i>what we know as an earthquake.</i>
                        Due to their cause, it would make sense that earthquakes tend to happen local
                        to the meeting point of two or more techtonic plates.
                        This is what can be seen in the map, where most events occur along the lines of
                        adjoining techtonic plates.
                        From the map, it could be argued that <strong>the more techtonic plates meet at a
                            position</strong>,
                        the <strong>more likely that position is to experience an earthquake</strong> at a given time,
                        and the <strong>higher in magnitude</strong> those earthquakes tend to be.

        <h2 style="font-size: xx-large;">The Richter Scale as a Measure of Magnitude</h2>
        <div id="container" style="display: flex;">

            <img style="height:auto; width:43vw; margin:5vh 6vw;"
                src="https://t3.ftcdn.net/jpg/01/73/64/58/360_F_173645818_uDkjd2dipJlWuAjLeJqBZFggbovvSVAD.jpg">
            <div style="width:35vw; margin:5vh 0vw;">
                <p align="justify" style="font-size: x-large;">An earthquake's magnitude is measured using the <strong>"Richter Scale"</strong>.
                    This is a base-10 logarithmic scale,
                    implying that an earthquake that has a magnitude 1 higher on the Richter scale actually had an
                    intensity
                    that was <i>10x as great</i>. When trying to decide how badly a country has been affected by
                    earthquakes, it is
                    important to take into consideration both the <i>volume</i> of earthquakes experienced, but also the
                    <i>intensity</i>
                    of each of those earthquakes. Using the cumulative magnitude bar plot above is one way we can
                    attempt to
                    identify those countries which have been the most affected. From this method, it would appear that
                    <strong>Chile (with a cumulative magnitude of 187.3) has been the most affected</strong>, within the
                    timeline of this data.

                        While the Richter Scale is used to measure the <i>intensity</i> of earthquakes,
                        the <strong>PAGER Alert Level System</strong> is designed to measure their <i>impact</i>.
